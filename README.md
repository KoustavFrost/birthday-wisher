### How to setup

1. Clone the app.
2. Sign in into [Facebook Developer](developers.facebook.com).
3. Create an app.
4. Get the appID.
5. Copy and paste it in the app.js file.
6. Run a localserver. I used Apache. Command: php -S localhost:port_number. EX: php -S localhost:8080
7. Paste the localhost URL in the Facebook Login under Products.

## Development Status: Had to stop development because Facebook API does not work with HTTP localservers, need to figure out a way.
